# Design Patterns in Node.js

This is a simple demonstrates the implementation of design patterns using Node.js. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design, and they can help you write code that is more maintainable, scalable, and flexible.

## Introduction

I explore various design patterns and demonstrate their usage through practical examples. The design patterns covered in this repo include:

- Singleton Pattern
- Repository Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- and more...

Each design pattern is explained with a brief overview, followed by examples of how it can be implemented in Node.js. The project structure is organized by design pattern, making it easy to navigate and understand.
